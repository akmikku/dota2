homie was the chosen one but went dark

he was powered by the souls of his people

dark ichor flowed through him and instead of consuming him he let it flow to his people then enslaved them

this dark ichor was coming from bane (dark manifestation of the blood of the gods)

juggernaut and grimstroke were near each other

xin was grimstroke's teacher

xin was murdered by (grimstroke? nah juggy is cooler - also was taught by xin but when he saw what grimstroke did he killed his old master)

after murdering xin - he is reborn being true neutral again 

grimstroke was corrupted by void spirit (his other teacher - but not willingly grimstroke peered into the void and saw the ichor flowing through bane and wanted to steal it's power) but juggernaut did not know this and thought xin had corrupted grimstroke

but when he finds out the truth he resurrects xin through a sacred flame ritual

the goal is to get this dark ichor flowing to the flayed twins 

via bloodseeker's blades
