Mask - Yurnero's legacy

Each juggernaut (warrior) carries their ancestry with them (via their mask)
thats why when they break thousands of souls are broken 

sven broke juggys mask

sven is a mommys boi
human meranth hybrid

meranth vs leviathan vs slithereen 

slithereens can regrow appendages

goal of slithereen campaign is to get gem of true sight - it's hidden near the north coast of the arctic

tidehunter worships maelron and cannot rest until the gem is returned - probably antagonist of siltbreaker campaign since goal is to get the gem

gem of true sight after kunkka + tide battle was guarded by the slithereen (slardar + naga) and inscribed in the chalice of dourne 

tide attacked the slithereen as well to try and recover the gem but slark slipped away with it in the heat of battle 

naga is exiled because gem was stolen + slardar is helping her look for it and retrieve it

maelron is a chuthulic beast who lives in a pool of his own creation

looks like a mind flayer but aqua form

he lives in a massive whirlpool - he created a large crack in the world and pulled water to the surface 

god of the seas

gem of true sight allows people to reveal maelron in his physical form

the conclave is a secret society of fish people trying to keep the peace between the drylanders and oceanic races

but instead they are trying to gain more political powers thru experemintation (i.e. creating siltbreaker)

siltbreaker was imprisoned in dark reef for 41 years and bound by runes that increased in strength as his power rose

siltbreaker drew his strength into that of rhyzik (a large sand king like creature)

after killing rhyzik siltbreaker gains some of his strength back and heroes have to fight it 

siltbreaker trying to pull a kyogre basically by destroying the conclave 

nothl realm - place where spirits go after death 

siltbreaker tells dazzle he been to nothl realm

siltbreaker main power is to control peoples minds
