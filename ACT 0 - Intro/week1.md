## Intro: 

Welcome to the land of the [Quarternene Plane](#quarternene_pane) - a world full of magic, adventure, friends, treachery, cunning, sorrow; gods old and new and most importantly of heroes. You have been invited from a mysterious wealthy individual to go aboard an all expenses paid vacation to a new island luxury resort that is being built but is open to the public a month early for a private experience. Many affluent, famous or otherwise noteworthy guests have been invited to take part in the festivities rumored to last a month. The players have gathered here on Ash Archipelago, a sparsely popualted beach town where the travel ship is moored on the docks. 

```
Take time here to have the players introduce their characters and then tie in what possible reasonsings they may have to go on the all expenses paid vacation
```
After the players have introduced themselves they board the ship "La Isla Trifecta" with the words "Let's go for a ride" etched below the ship name. There are no guests that stand out to you in the vicinity of the entrance but you notice many attractive waiters and waitresses walking around in floral patterns directing guests to their rooms or special places of interest on the ship and offering cocktails out of coconuts. As your party begins to walk along the length of the ship away from the entrance you see it is distinclty divided in two with one half having a light airy elegant atmosphere full of Hors d'œuvres and champagne whereas the other is brimming with a darker smoky air coming from cigars with the pungent afternotes of potent whiskeys.

```
If players would like to they can take the time to explore the ship and roll for investigation. 

🎲 (DC 5) No one knows the owner of the enterprise but people have heard of their eccentricness and fodness for liquor. 
🎲 (DC 10) On a good roll many guests can be overheard talking about how the owner of the new island is a conservationist but also has a quick temper.
🎲 (DC 15) You overhear guests saying that the owner of the island is a native and has resided there for many years and the luxury resort the ship is headed to is his first big venture. 
🎲 (DC 20) You peek through the cargo hold as you are passing by and notice a tarp is slighty uncovered on an unlabeled box and upon inspection you can see firebombs neatly lined up in the crate. You also overhear a crewmember talking about the secret surprise for the guests - an exquisite bat sancutary that is set to open to the public near the end of the excursion. 
```

Players can then continue exploring the ship or return to their quarters to rest for the night before arriving at the tourist resort in the Tangled Tropics on the Jidi Isles. 

Upon departure from La Isla Trifecta the party is greeted with a beachfront of activities from beach volleyball to surfing and fishing the idyllic beach vacation awaits. You can see a ferris wheel in the distance and high rises with flashy casino signs. Large ornate fountains and statues mixed in with vibrant flora adorn the streets and roundabouts leading up to the city. The broadwalk on the beach has straw shops full of tourist items, margaritas, and all sorts of fun and festive items that a vacation needs. The final little stream of guests merrily make their way down the docks while tired deckhands can be seen starting the process of cleaning up the boat and moving the cargo out of the hull. Looking back at the beach your party can see a board with guest, family, and group names written on it and a house number and address written next to them. You spot where your beach house is and head there to drop off your belongings for your month long stay.

```
Take some time here to explore the island and the players can do some fun activities. Key locations/events to watch out for that can trigger an important roll: 

1. Barkeep - If any member of the party asks around for a drinking contest and wins it then the barkeep will give you gold and some information about the owner of the place (roll 🎲  athletics). If successful you get information about the big boss (Batrider).

2. If any member of the party tries to enter the large covered sanctuary that has a "Do not enter" "Under construction" sign around it then (roll 🎲  athletics) to try and enter. Upon successful entry you will see the big boss (Batrider).

3. If any member of the party tries to explore the nature (forested) area and roll investigation at nighttime based on a DC 🎲 15+ roll wout nightvision and a DC 🎲 10+ roll with nightvision - they might be able to spot the shapes of bats flying around at dusk off in the distance but they have to be near the forest area. 

4. If any member of the party tries to woo the dealer and succeds a DC 🎲 20+ charisma check then it is also possible to get information about the big boss (Batrider) from the casino dealers/employees. 
``` 

After exploring the locations and activities the party eventually encounters the big boss of the place - [Batrider](#batrider_info). He explains how he is mentally torn and has two ragin personalities - conservationism and capitalism. Whichever side of him is active acts on things but one thing always remains the same - his love for his beloved pet bats. This has caused him to go to great extents to provide land and sanctuary to his bats but lately a great plague has fallen upon the Jidi Isles. A long time ago a herablist known as [Lesale](#venomancer_info) had gone looking for power in the form of herbs mashed together to create fantastical and potent potions. He stumbled upon a small jungle colony of tribal shamanic folk that lived near the temple of [Aktok](#aktok_info). There he perfected his craft but the power cost him his humanity as he merged flesh and spirit into a posionous reptile with the sole purpose of spreading his noxious plague through the forests of these isles. This poison has been devastating the Morde-bat population and mutating them into glowbats and other types of vicious bat species. 

He needs your party's help and is willing to give you all a substantial sum of money and also connections to future adventures and revenue if you can help him save his bats. He needs you all to get stronger first though because the threat of the Venomancer is not to be taken lightly. His poison seeps through armor and has lingering hallucogenic effects if not removed quickly. A weakly equipped party will stumble and fall in front of the might of Aktok's chosen. This is why he recommends you to visit some of his friends who are trying to unearth an artifact and keep the peace on another island a few nights of travel away - Howling Weald. He tells you that he will equip you with food and rations for travel and needs you to take a scroll that may assist the efforts of his friends in the Howling Weald - Captain Lightfoot & Commander Targan. 

Should you accept the quest you will be offered a hefty sum of 500 gold per person half paid upon arrival from the Howling Weald and the other half paid upon the termination of the Venomancer. 


... Onto week 2
